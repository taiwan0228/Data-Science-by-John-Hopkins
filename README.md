# Data-Science-by-John-Hopkins

This repository is for Data Science Specialization offered by John Hopkins University on Coursera platform.

This series of courses on Coursera teaches another popular, open source language R, to students or professionals who want to step into the world of Data Science.  

Even though it teaches R, not Python, the most popular Data Science language, R is considered the "statisticians' language" and has a massive ecosystem with quite complete libraries for statistical analysis and modeling.

When people are talking about and debating which of the two languages to choose from, note that eventually you would like to have both under your belt.
